### Project Overview
Utilizing a unsupervised machine learning, I have analyzed cyrptocurrencies in efforts for an investment bank to create a new crptocurrency investment porfolio offering to their clients.

#### Methods Utilized:
  - Clustering via K-Means
  - Create vizualizations via 2d and 3d scatter plots

#### Tools Utilized
  - Cypto_Data data source 
  - Python
  - Jupyter Notebook
